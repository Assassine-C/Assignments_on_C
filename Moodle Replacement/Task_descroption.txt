Task Description:

This project implements a simple Course Management System that handles students,
exams, and grades. It supports adding, searching, updating, listing, and deleting
student and exam records. Exams can be either written (with a specified duration)
or digital (requiring specific software).

The system processes a set of text commands from an input.txt file and writes the
corresponding outputs to output.txt. It includes input validation for all fields
(IDs, names, grades, etc.) and provides appropriate success or error messages
based on the operations.

Main operations include:

Adding students, exams, and grades

Searching for student or grade information

Updating exam details or grades

Listing all students

Deleting a student (along with all their grades)

The program continues processing commands until the END command is received.
