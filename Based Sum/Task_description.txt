Task Description:

Read a list of numbers, each given in different number bases (binary, octal, decimal, or hexadecimal).
Each number's base is specified separately. Convert all numbers to decimal, adjust them based on their
index (subtract 10 from even-indexed numbers, add 10 to odd-indexed numbers), and output the sum of the
final values. If any input is invalid for its specified base, output "Invalid inputs".

Input:

An integer N (number of numbers).

A space-separated list of N numbers.

A list of N bases (2, 8, 10, or 16).

Output:

The total sum after adjustments, or "Invalid inputs" if any number is incorrectly formatted.

Input and output are handled via input.txt and output.txt files.
